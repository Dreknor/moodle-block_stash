Block Stash
===========

Engage your students! Gamify your courses by hiding objects for your students to find.

Features
--------

- Create any object you like
- Hide objects throughout your course in any possible location
- Set objects to automatically re-appear after a delay to boost engagement
- Unlock access to activities based on the objects found (requires plugin [availability_stash](https://moodle.org/plugins/availability_stash))

Requirements
------------

Moodle 2.9 or greater.

Installation
------------

Simply install the plugin and add the block to a course page.

Getting started
---------------

1. Create a new item
2. Create a new location for that item
3. Copy the code snippet for that location
4. Directly paste the code in the HTML view of your editor

When viewing the content the object will now appear.
Note that teachers cannot pick up the objects, for them they will always re-appear.

Restricting access based on students' objects
