<p>Locations are places where your items are in the <em>virtual world</em>. Without a <em>location</em> an item cannot be picked up by a student.</p>
<p>Locations come with a few options, including the number of times a single student can pick them up, and how often they reappear after being picked up.</p>
<p>For instance, if your students need a <em>key item</em> to access an activity, you will most likely set it so that your students can only pick it up once in that location.</p>
<p>But if they need <em>5 coins</em> to access another one, you may set this coin to reappear each day to encourage them to visit the course everyday.</p>
<p>Note that items do not magically appear in your course, you will have to add a special code to your content in order for the item to be displayed.</p>
